  Welcome to the Batiq project! This repository contains the code and resources for generating African Batik prints using StyleGAN. Our aim is to leverage the power of deep learning to create unique and authentic Batik designs, celebrating the rich heritage of African culture.
</p>

## Project Overview 💡
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to generate African Batik prints using StyleGAN. The primary goal is to produce high-quality, unique Batik designs that can be used by artisans and designers. The project involves data collection, model development, validation, testing, and creating a user-friendly interface for generating new prints.

## Dataset 📊
We use a custom dataset containing images of African Batik prints. The dataset includes various Batik patterns and designs. We preprocess the data by handling missing values, resizing images, and normalizing pixel values. [Link to Kaggle dataset here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikuns/african-fabric)

## Data Preprocessing 📋
The data preprocessing involves:
- Cleaning the data by removing any missing or inconsistent values.
- Resizing images to a consistent size for model input.
- Normalizing pixel values to the range [-1, 1].

## Feature Engineering 🔍
Feature engineering steps include:
- Extracting style and content features from the images.
- Using AdaIN (Adaptive Instance Normalization) to combine content and style features.

## Model Training 🧑🏻‍💻
The StyleGAN model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. We trained the model on the preprocessed dataset, adjusting hyperparameters such as the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the learning rate. We used techniques like regularization and dropout to prevent overfitting.

## Evaluation and Optimization 📈
Once the model was trained, we evaluated its performance using various metrics. We computed metrics such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID) to assess the quality of generated images. Optimization techniques, including parameter tuning and cross-validation, were employed to enhance model performance.

#### Model Details
- **Model Architecture:** The StyleGAN model consists of several layers with adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN). The optimizer used is Adam.
- **Hyperparameters:** The best hyperparameters were found using Grid Search CV with the following values:
  - Learning rate: 0.0001
  - Batch size: 16

#### Evaluation
- **Training Performance:** The model was trained for 100 epochs with early stopping to prevent overfitting. The training loss consistently decreased, indicating the model's ability to learn from the data.
- **Example Outputs:** The model's generated prints were visually assessed to ensure quality and diversity.

#### Discussion
- **Strengths:** The StyleGAN model effectively captures the intricate patterns and designs of Batik prints, making it suitable for generative art applications. The model achieved a low FID score, indicating high-quality outputs.
- **Limitations:** The model's performance can vary with different hyperparameters and requires careful tuning. The diversity of generated prints can be further improved.
- **Areas for Improvement:** Future work could explore alternative model architectures, such as GANs with different normalization techniques, and incorporate additional features like texture or color patterns to enhance the quality of generated prints.
